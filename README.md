        Daimler Trucks, North Carolina – Key Performance Indicators
    </strong>
    March 2017
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Developed a Key Performance Indicators in process dashboard for Daimler
Trucks using <strong>Tableau</strong> and <strong>D3</strong> language.        <strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        Dataset is provided by “Daimler Trucks- North America” after an
in-plant requirement analysis session with company’s employees.        <strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        The dashboard can load the shift wise data provided from different
        units of manufacturing plant and generates performance indicators
        visualizations for decision making by higher officials of Daimler
        Trucks.<strong></strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        The dashboard includes visualizations of trend detection of production,
        detection of employee’s performance, detection of reasons causing
        production delay, etc.<strong></strong>
